            Update README and pyproject.toml with current supported Python versions

            Auto-updated by update-readme workflow based on current ESP-IDF and Python support lifecycle.

            Changes:
            - Updated supported Python versions in README.md based on dynamic version detection
            - Updated ruff target-version and mypy python_version in pyproject.toml
            - Python versions are determined by ESP-IDF lifecycle and Python EOL dates

            ## Summary
            This PR automatically updates README.md and pyproject.toml with the current supported Python versions based on our dynamic version detection system.

            ## Changes Made
            - ✅ Updated "Supported Python versions" section in README.md
            - ✅ Updated ruff `target-version` in pyproject.toml
            - ✅ Updated mypy `python_version` in pyproject.toml
            - 🔄 Based on ESP-IDF lifecycle and Python EOL dates
            - 🤖 Generated by automated workflow

            ## Python Versions Updated
            The following Python versions are currently supported:
            ```
            ${{ steps.generate.outputs.supported_python }}
            ```

            ## Verification
            - [ ] Python versions in README match our build matrix
            - [ ] pyproject.toml ruff target-version uses oldest Python version
            - [ ] pyproject.toml mypy python_version uses oldest Python version
            - [ ] No other sections of files were modified
            - [ ] All supported versions are actively maintained
